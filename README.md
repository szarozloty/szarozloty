- 👋 Hi, I’m @szarozloty, I'm PLC programmer for now, but looking to rebrand myself.
- 👀 I’m interested in meeting intresting people and traveling across the world. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python. I'm wondering about java, but for now python will do 👌
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mentoring/supporting my learn process i suppose. For now I fell like i just really need to catch up alot with programming,
      but then i'd be more than open for some collaborations!
